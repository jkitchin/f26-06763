"""Build the Assignment 1 evidence report.

Run this in the root of your project, the directory holding `pyproject.toml`:

    python3 a01-evidence.py --andrew-id yourid --name "Your Name"

It writes `evidence.pdf`. Upload that to Canvas. That PDF is your submission, so
read it before you send it.

WHAT IT DOES. It runs the commands in the assignment's Definition of done and
records what they actually printed, then embeds the files a grader needs to
read: your `pyproject.toml`, your package, the code cells of your notebook, and
your README. Nothing is invented. If a command fails, the
failure goes in the report, which is better for you than a report that quietly
omits it: a report showing one broken command and five working ones is worth
more marks than no report at all.

It deletes `.venv` and rebuilds it with `uv sync --locked`, because that rebuild
is what the first 30 points are for. That is the only destructive thing it does,
and it is the same thing the assignment asks you to do by hand at least once.

NAMES. The assignment prescribes names (`sensorlab`, `src/sensorlab/train.py`,
`notebooks/explore.ipynb`, `README.md`, `sqlite:///mlflow.db`) and this script
looks for those first. It also goes looking when it does not find them, so a
project laid out sensibly under different names still produces a report rather
than a page of failures. What it found is printed at the top of the report, and
every guess can be overridden with --module, --notebook or --tracking-uri. If
the header says it used something you did not intend, pass the flag and run it
again.

The PDF is written here, with no browser and no LaTeX and nothing to install, so
every submission arrives in the same shape and there is no print dialog to get
wrong.

Standard library only, so it runs on the system Python without being installed
into your project. It shells out to `uv`, and to nothing else.
